# Columbia University Coding Bootcamp - Work Day Scheduler: Challenge 5: 

## Description

This project is a learning assignment derivative of html and css starter code given in the [credits](#credits) section. 

The goal was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
